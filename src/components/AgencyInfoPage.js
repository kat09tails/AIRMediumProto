          <p id="serviceDescription">
            There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold<br />
            The arctic trails have their secret tails that would make your blood run cold<br />
            The northern lights have seen queer sights, but the queerest they ever did see<br />
            Was the night on the Marge of Lake LeMarge, I cremated Same McGee.<br />

          <h4>Service #2 Name: </h4>
          <p id="serviceDescription">
            Now Sam McGee was from Tenessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.<br />
            Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the pole, God only knows.<br />
            He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him, like a spell, <br />
            though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd "rather be in hell". <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Service #3 Name: </h4>
        <p id="serviceDescription">
          On Crhistmas day we were mushing our way over the Dawson Trail.<br />
          Talk of your cold! Through the parka's fold, it stapped like a driven nail. <br />
          If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze, 'till sometimes we couldn't see,<br />
          and it wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam Mcgee.<br />
